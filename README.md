# Get It Done! (Firebase & React To-Do Application)

This is a simple To-Do Application that uses Firebase services as the backend and simple React for the frontend. The inspiration for this project comes from my new-found knowledge of Firebase. I wanted to put into practice what I learned about Firestore and Firebase authentication. Along with this, I also wanted to practice my fundamental knowledge of React.
